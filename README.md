This template provides a minimal setup to get Capsule Pre-generated wallets working in a Mini-App

# Usage

First, deploy your app to a link (This repo is hosted [here](https://capsule-org.github.io/capsule-telegram-miniapp/))

Then, make a telegram bot [(See Telegram's Guide Here)](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial) and point it to open this link

Note, you can start signing transactions as soon as the wallet is created. However, make sure the user doesn't close the app until storage of the user share is completed.
